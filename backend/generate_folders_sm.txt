You have a set of file names, each assigned to a cluster based on semantic similarity. Your task is to determine the best folder name for each cluster and list all file names in that cluster under the corresponding folder.

Input:
A list of file names and their cluster labels:

[file_name_1] -> [cluster_label_1]
[file_name_2] -> [cluster_label_1]
[file_name_3] -> [cluster_label_2]
...
Clustering results: File names grouped into clusters.

Output:
For each cluster, output:

Folder Name: [folder_name]
  - [file_name_1]
  - [file_name_2]
  ...

  
Instructions:
Choose a folder name that reflects the cluster's content.
List all files in the cluster under the folder.
Maintain consistent formatting.
